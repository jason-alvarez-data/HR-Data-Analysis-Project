# Define Your Objective

Primary Objective

Analyze the Human Resources data to identify key actionable insights to stakeholders for improving employee diversity, equity and job satisfaction.

# Understand the Data

Dataset Overview

Initially when began reviewing the dataset, I decided to make the columns widths all the same to make the data view consistent. Additionally, I was able to identify possible insights that I would be able to draw from the dataset. The possible insights were as follows:

- Job satisfaction between high earners and typical earning employees.
- Job satisfaction compared to “years since last promotion”.
- Distribution of salary range and education field.
- Salary distribution and department.
- Distribution of salary and gender.
- Gender distribution by department.

Data Cleaning Process

My data cleaning process went as follows:

- Checked the spelling of the data for any mistakes that could be present.
- Converted the data into a table in Excel that makes it easier to analysis the data in the later stages of my process.
- Checked column filters for potential blanks (if there were any blanks then I could fill them in with data or add a null value)
- Checked for empty rows that I could delete from the data.
- Removed any unused columns that I had planned for my data analysis.

Data Visualization

The bar chart illustrates the average monthly salary across various job roles. The orange bars represent the salaries of male employees, while the blue bars represent the salaries of female employees in the corresponding roles.

The line chart below illustrates the average job satisfaction scores for each job role within the organization. The orange line represents the scores for male employees, while the blue line represents the scores for female employees.

# Feature Engineering

# Analyze KPIs

Female Employee Count | 588

Female Max Salary | $16,915

Male Employee Count | 882

Male Max Salary | $17,409

The above KPIs show that the organization’s workforce is 40% female and 60% male for their employees. While the maximum salary for male employees is $494 dollars higher than that for female employees.

# Model Building (if applicable)

# Interpret Results

Based off the above analysis of the KPIs, I would recommend the following:

- Conduct a detailed salary distribution analysis to identify any potential disparities.
- Review roles and experience levels to ensure equitable salary practices.
- Implement measures to address any identified gender-based salary gaps.

The importance of these recommendations are supported by the bar chart presented earlier in this report where it displayed the distribution of the monthly salaries across job roles based on gender.

Recommendations based off job satisfaction scores are as follows:

- Investigate the factors contributing to high satisfaction in certain roles and replicate these practices across other roles.
- Address any identified disparities in job satisfaction to ensure a more equitable and positive work environment for all employees.

The primary focus of my analysis was to assess the diversity and equity of employees across the organization. However, during this process, I identified a potentially significant issue within the Human Resources department. The overall job satisfaction in this department is the lowest among all departments. With a total of 52 employees, this low satisfaction rating could stem from various factors.

# Review and Iterate

The job satisfaction rating of the Human Resources department should be a primary objective for future organizational analysis. Insights gained from reviewing this department could be beneficial for other departments that do not experience similar low job satisfaction. These findings could contribute to the ongoing improvement of the entire organization.
